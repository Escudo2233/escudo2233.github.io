    <br>
    <p>
        Heyo! Like I said, name's Escudo. I'm currently a Computer Science student, but I do a variety of other things.
        I program, I draw maps, I moderate, and I occasionally take some pretty pictures.
    </p>

<div class="main">
    <h2 style="text-align: center">I Program</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm currently a Freshman Computer Science student, which means I still have a bunch to learn. Why did I put this
        here? I'm being graded for this, so I kinda have to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bulk of my programming experience is in Python, since it is my programming language of choice. I am
        currently not interested in programming jobs.
    </p>

<div class="main">
    <h2 style="text-align: center">I Draw Maps</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I've always enjoyed drawing maps, and I recently took up digital drawing. Here are a few of my maps:

    <p>
        I take cartography commissions! If you'd like me to draw maps for your worldbuilding project or tabletop game,
        you can check my commission sheet here.

    <h2 style="text-align: center">I Moderate</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        I've been a Discord moderator for a couple of years. Here are the servers I help out at:

        I've been know to take a picture or two. Currently looking for a camera, so I can take a few more pictures.
        Here's a little sample:

        Hello! My name is Escudo (or at least I go by Escudo online), and I made this website. Pretty neat huh? I guess
        I should add more pertinent information about myself though. Were to begin?
    </p>
    <p>
        Well for starters, I'm a 19-year-old Computer Science student who lives in Portugal (specifically, the Azores).
        I'm Portuguese-Canadian, and I like to draw stuff, mostly maps.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm pretty well-versed in both Portuguese and English, though I'm understandably more well-read on the former.
        I enjoy reading the Portuguese literature classics, but overall I'm mostly a sucker for a good fantasy book
        (read the Mistborn trilogy). If I'm not reading or drawing, I'm probably playing something. From TTRPGs to
        their videogame counterparts. I also have a passing interest in woodworking and the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm an avid collector of knowledge. I enjoy learning a lot of things in a lot of different areas, but I wouldn't
        have taken up Computer Science if I didn't have a particular fondness for computers. I still somewhat naively
        hope to make a game someday.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's with the profile picture thing? Is that a coin? Yes, it is. "Escudo" is the name of the currency Portugal
        used before the Euro was a thing, and it means "Shield". I've used it as my profile picture in a lot of places,
        it's become sort of my thing. Can't really explain why, I just think it looks neat.
    </p>
    <p>
        So there you have it, a brief explanation of what goes on inside this head.
